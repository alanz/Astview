Astview is a graphical viewer for abstract syntax trees. It is
implemented on the basis of scrap-your-boilerplate (i.e.  data2tree)
and works with all parsers that generate trees that are instances of
the Data.Data class.  Custom parsers can be dynamically loaded (via
package hint) at startup.

Details on installation and configuration of custom parsers can be
found in INSTALL
