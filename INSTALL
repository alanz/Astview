Installation and Configuration
------------------------------


Dependencies
------------

Astview depends on a number of packages:

  * hint,   the haskell interpreter, allows to load custom parsers at
            startup. 
  * gtk2hs, the haskell-bindings to the GTK GUI framework
  * syb,    the 'scrap-your-boilerplate' approach to generic
            programming


For details see file 'astview.cabal' and the documentation of gtk2hs
(especially for required system-libraries like gtksourceview)

The parsers that are initally configured require the packages

  * parsec
  * haskell-src-exts


Installation
------------

We use a custom build to generate HTML-documentation. The custom
Setup.hs needs the package hscolour. You have to install it via

  cabal install hscolour

To install astview, just run 'cabal install' in the astview-directory.

To launch astview, just issue the command 'astview' in your
'.cabal/bin' directory.


Configuration
-------------

To add custom parsers, you have to edit the file
~/.cabal/share/astview-a.b/Parsers.hs and conform to the signatures of
the exported function. The parsers have to generate haskell terms
which are fully (i.e. all used types) in the Data class.
